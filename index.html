            <hr>

            <div>The University of Calgary was <b><u>established in 1966</b></u>, but its roots date 
                back more than half a century earlier to the establishment of the Normal 
                School in Calgary in 1905. The Alberta Normal School was established in 
                Calgary to train primary and secondary school teachers in the new province. 
                The Calgary Normal School was absorbed by the University of Alberta's Faculty 
                of Education in 1945, and operated as a part of its Calgary branch campus, a 
                satellite campus of the University of Alberta. Operating from the west wing of 
                the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art, the Calgary University Committee 
                was formed 1946, in an effort to lobby for separate permanent facilities for the 
                branch campus.

            <h3>21st century</h3>

            <div>In May 2001, the University of Calgary tartan was accredited in a ceremony presided 
                over by the president of the Scottish Tartans Society, and the director of the Register 
                of All Publicly Known Tartans. The accreditation ceremony for the university's tartan was 
                the first to take place in Canada. Use of the black, red, and gold tartan is limited to 
                formal ceremonies, convocations, and a small number of items sold by the university. The 
                tartan is also used by the university's pipe band.

            <h3>West Campus Development Project</h3>

            <div>In 2007, the University of Calgary, in partnership with the City of Calgary, began work 
                on the West Campus Development Project through the West Campus Development Trust. As the 
                lead developer for University District, the trust will oversee the development of the 
                lands adjacent to the main campus, formerly known as the West Campus lands.
