            The governance of the University of Calgary is conducted through a board of governors and a senate. The role of the
            board of governors and the senate is governed under the Post Secondary Learning Act, a provincial act of the Legislative
            Assembly of Alberta. The board of governors is responsible for the university's conduct, management, and control of the
            university and its property, revenues, business, and other affairs. Members of the board of governors include the
            chancellor of the university, the university president, two alumni nominated by the alumni association, a member of the
            university senate, nine members of the general public, as well as three students, and three staff members nominated by
            their respective associations.

            The University Senate acts as an outreach body between the university and the wider community. The university's senate
            is made up of 62 members of the alumni association, academic staff, the student body, and the general public, as
            identified by the Post-Secondary Learning Act. Members of the senate include various members of the university
            community, including the university president, the chief academic officer of student affairs, academic staff, as well a
            one undergraduate and graduate student appointed by their respective student association. In addition to members of the
            university community, the senate also includes nine members of the general public, appointed by the Alberta Minister of
            Advanced Education. In relation to its mandate, the university senate is also the governing body that authorizes
            issuance of honorary degrees.
